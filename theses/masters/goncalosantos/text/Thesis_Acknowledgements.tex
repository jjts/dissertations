I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to my advisor, Professor José
Teixeira de Sousa, for his guidance during the development of this thesis. In
particular for his relentless patience in the early stages of this work and many
useful improvements and suggestions.  Without his suggestions and support,
specially in the hectic days before the completion of my work, this thesis would
not have been possible.

I also wish to thank Professor Paulo Flores since his insightful comments
allowed me to improve this dissertation.

I am also thankful to my friends and course mates who helped me grow as a person
and made it less difficult to be engaged in my master's degree.  I am thankful
to my friends who were by my side during this phase, for companionship, strength
and support in difficult times.

In these acknowledgments, I also cannot forget my parents for their persistent
encouragements.
