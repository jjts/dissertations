This set of files provide a template for using LaTeX to write a Master
or PhD thesis according to the IST regulations.

The main file is 'Thesis.tex' and it includes all the other .tex files
in the ZIP package:

	Thesis.TeX
		Thesis_Preamble.tex
		Thesis_FrontCover.tex
		Thesis_Dedication.tex
		Thesis_Acknowledgements.tex
		Thesis_Resumo.tex
		Thesis_Abstract.tex
		Thesis_Nomenclature.tex
		Thesis_Glossary.tex
		Thesis_Introduction.tex
		Thesis_<new chapters>.tex
		Thesis_Results.tex
		Thesis_Conclusions.tex
		Thesis_Appendix.tex
		Thesis_bib_DB.bib

It is not required that you are familiar with LaTeX since the files
should be quite self explanatory.
Please be sure you understand the structure before you start editing.

Just use the make file 'Makefile' to process the LaTeX code and output
the PDF file.
Under Linux, this means typing 'make' at the terminal prompt.

To run LaTeX on Windows, it is required to install additional software,
if it has not been done before.

The instructions below are just one possible solution, but it proved
robust during tests.

------------------------
a) Software download

i) compiler: MiKTeX 2.9
Download from http://miktex.org/2.9/setup

This version appears to be quite stable. Search for more recent releases
if available.

ii) text editor: Texmaker 4.1.1
Download from http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html

This editor is nice because it allows two windows,
showing both the source code and the compiled pdf, simultaneously.
It also automatically installs and updates any necessary LaTeX package.

------------------------
b) Installation notes

i) MiKTeX
First install this compiler. Just follow the on screen instructions.

Accept the default directory paths so that Texmaker can automatically
find the required executables for compilation (pdflatex, makeindex,
bibtex, etc).

ii) Texmaker
After the compiler is installed, the TeX editor can then be installed.
Follow the on screen instructions.

After installation, it is necessary to configure the compilation
commands and, optionally, define shortcuts.

Texmaker -> Options (menu bar) -> Configure Texmaker ->
Compile (left menu) -> User

Add the following commands (this replicates the makefile used in Linux):

pdflatex %.tex |
makeindex %.glo -s %.ist -t %.glg -o %.gls |
makeindex %.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o %.nls |
bibtex %.aux |
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex |
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex |
"C:/Program Files/Adobe/Reader 9.0/Reader/AcroRd32.exe" %.pdf

The last command is optional and depends on the version of Acrobat
Reader installed.
If it is not installed, download it from http://get.adobe.com/reader/

------------------------
c) Compile LaTeX source

To compile, just click on the blue arrow next to "Compile", making sure the main TeX source is open.

To compile from any open file, the compilation commands have to be edited, replacing % by the main file name.

------------------------
d) Define shortcuts (optional)

It is possible to program shortcuts.
It is advisable to assign the function keys Fx to the "compile", "clean" and "see pdf" functions.
