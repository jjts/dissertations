I want to thank my supervisor, Professor José Teixeira de Sousa, for the 
opportunity to develop this work and for his guidance and support during that process. 
His help was fundamental to overcome the multiple obstacles that I faced during this work.

I also want to acknowledge Professor Horácio Neto for providing a simple Convolutional 
Neural Network application, used as a basis for the application developed for the 
RV32-Versat architecture.

A special acknowledgement goes to my friends, for their continuous support, and Válter,  
that is developing a multi-layer architecture for RV32-Versat. When everything seemed to 
be doomed he always had a miraculous solution.

Finally, I want to express my sincere gratitude to my family for giving me all the 
support and encouragement that I needed throughout my years of study and through the 
process of researching and writing this thesis. They are also part of this work.\\

\textbf{Thank you.}
